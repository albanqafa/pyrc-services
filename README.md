# pyrc-services
Common IRC services written as python bots

Thought it would be fun to write my own IRC services. Right now only NickServ is started, the most basic implementations of REGISTER and IDENTIFY are mostly done.

Will probably finish NickServ and make it not so ugly, then start writing other IRC services.
